Examples:

nohup ./g15composer /path/to/pipe &

1) echo 'TL "Hello" "World"' > /path/to/pipe

2) cat instructions > /path/to/pipe

3) ./some_script > /path/to/pipe
     where some_script is a bash, Perl, etc. script or application which outputs
     one or more of the commands listed below.

*** Text Commands:

Ts "line 1" "line 2" ...
   where s is the size of the font (S, M and L are supported).
   To insert a double-quote, prefix it with a backslash

TO X Y S C "line 1" "line 2" ... 
   Overlays text of the given size at (X,Y), centered if C=1

*** Font Command: (NB., G15Composer and libg15render must both be configured with --enable-ttf to use font commands)

FL F S "/path/to/font" 
   Loads a font into Face Slot F with size S.

FP F S X Y Co Ce "line 1" "line 2" ...
   Prints text using the font is Slot F with size S at position (X,Y).
   Text will be printed in color Co and will be centered if Ce=1.
   
*** Pixel Commands:

PO X Y W H 100101101... 
   Overlays a pixel image of the given Width and Height at (X,Y)

PS X Y C
   Sets the pixel at (X,Y) to color C (0 or 1)
   
PC 0|1
   Clears the screen and fills it with 0|1

PF X1 Y1 X2 Y2 C
   Fills the area from (X1,Y1) to (X2,Y2) with color C

PR X1 Y1 X2 Y2
   Reverses the pixels from (X1,Y1) to (X2,Y2)

PB X1 Y1 X2 Y2 C T F
   Draws a box from (X1,Y1) to (X2,Y2) using color C and thickness T, filling if F=1
   C, T, and F are optional; defaults are C=1, T=1, and F=0

*** Drawing Commands:

DL X1 Y1 X2 Y2 C
   Draws a line from (X1,Y1) to (X2,Y2) using color C

DC X Y R F C
   Draws a circle centered at (X,Y) with radius R using color C, filling if F=1
   C and F are optional; defaults are C=1, F=0
   
DR X1 Y1 X2 Y2 F C
   Draws a rounded box from (X1,Y1) to (X2,Y2) using color C, filling if F=1
   C and F are optional; defaults are C=1, F=0
   
DB X1 Y1 X2 Y2 C N M T
   Draws a percentage or progress bar from (X1,Y1) to (X2,Y2) using color C
   The bar will be filled with N units out of M
   T sets the type of the bar, valid values are 1, 2, or 3
   T is optional; default value is T=1
   
*** Mode Commands:

MC 0|1
   Turns caching off or on, i.e. the changes are not immediately sent to the 
   LCD if caching is on (MC 1). Changes will be sent on the next MC 0.

MX 0|1
   Sets succeeding pixel colors to normal, or XORed with existing pixels.
   Good for drawing sprites with MC: 
      MC 1, draw, MC 0
      MC 1, redraw in original position and draw elsewhere, MC 0

   Old   New   Current   Redraw
    0     0     0^0 = 0   0^0 = 0
    0     1     0^1 = 1   1^1 = 0
    1     0     1^0 = 1   1^0 = 1
    1     1     1^1 = 0   0^1 = 1

MR 0|1
   Set succeeding pixel colors to normal, or reversed
   
MP 0|1|2
   Set screen to foreground if 0 and background if 1
   If 2, set screen to background if and only if user hasn't set it to foreground


----------------------

The following commands are relayed to g15daemon:

*** LCD Commands:

LB 0|1|2
   Sets the LCD brightness level

LC 0|1|2
   Sets the LCD contrast level


*** Keyboard/LED Commands:

KL 0|1|2
   Sets LED mode: 0=app-controlled 1=normal 2=sticky.
   Not currently implemented.

KM x 0|1
   Sets the Mx-light off or on. x=0,1,2,3 where 0 is all M-lights (minus MR).
   Only has an effect if KL is set to 0.
