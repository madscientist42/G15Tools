Examples:

nohup ./g15composer /path/to/pipe &

1) echo 'TL "Hello" "World"' > /path/to/pipe

2) cat instructions > /path/to/pipe

3) ./g15_script
     where g15_script starts with "#!/path/to/g15composer /path/to/pipe" and is executable
     There must be a running instance of g15composer listening at /path/to/pipe
     The rest of the lines should be made up of the commands listed below.

4) ./other_script > /path/to/pipe
     where other_script is a bash, Perl, etc. script or application which outputs
     one or more of the commands listed below.

*** Text Commands:

Ts "line 1" "line 2" ....
   where s is the size of the font (S, M and L are supported).
   To insert a double-quote, prefix it with a backslash

TO X Y s "line 1" "line 2" ... 
   Overlays text of the given size at (X,Y)


*** Pixel Commands:

PO X Y W H 100101101... 
   Overlays a pixel image of the given Width and Height at (X,Y)

PS X Y C
   Sets the pixel at (X,Y) to color C (0 or 1)

PF X1 Y1 X2 Y2 C
   Fills the area from (X1,Y1) to (X2,Y2) with color C

PR X1 Y1 X2 Y2
   Reverses the pixels from (X1,Y1) to (X2,Y2)

PL X1 Y1 X2 Y2 C
   Draws a line from (X1,Y1) to (X2,Y2) using color C

PB X1 Y1 X2 Y2 C T F
   Draws a box from (X1,Y1) to (X2,Y2) using color C and thickness T, filling if F=1
   C, T, and F are optional; defaults are C=1, T=1, and F=0


*** Mode Commands:

MC 0|1
   Turns caching off or on, i.e. the changes are not immediately sent to the 
   LCD if caching is on (MC 1). Changes will be sent on the next MC 0.

MX 0|1
   Sets succeeding pixel colors to normal, or XORed with existing pixels.
   Good for drawing sprites with MC: 
      MC 1, draw, MC 0
      MC 1, redraw in original position and draw elsewhere, MC 0

   Old   New   Current   Redraw
    0     0     0^0 = 0   0^0 = 0
    0     1     0^1 = 1   1^1 = 0
    1     0     1^0 = 1   1^0 = 1
    1     1     1^1 = 0   0^1 = 1

MR 0|1
   Set succeeding pixel colors to normal, or reversed
   
MP 0|1|2
   Set screen to foreground if 0 and background if 1
   If 2, set screen to background if and only if user hasn't set it to foreground

For convenience, here are the commands relayed to g15daemon:

*** Pixel Commands:

P 10010101001 .... with exactly (!) 6880 (160x43) 1 or 0's. The first 160
values are for line 0, the next 160 for line 1 etc


*** LCD Commands:

LB 0|1|2
   Sets the LCD brightness level

LC 0|1|2
   Sets the LCD contrast level


*** Keyboard/LED Commands:

KL 0|1|2
   Sets LED mode: 0=app-controlled 1=normal 2=sticky.

KM x 0|1
   Sets the Mx-light off or on. x=0,1,2,3,4|R where 0 is all M-lights.
   Only has an effect if KL is set to 0.
