1.0 
* Initial Release
1.0.1
* Change transfer type from interrupt to bulk for keypresses, which resolves
  problems for some people
1.1.0
* Add header define to allow for api version changes
* Add exitLibG15() to reset the device back to factory defaults on library exit.
1.1.1
* Add basic support for the G11 keyboard
* revert all bulk transfers - bulk transfers are illegal for low-speed
  devices, and cause -22 (EINVAL) warnings on new kernels.
* pass most errors to the client app.
SVN
* Add debugging function to enable/disable extra output
* All debugging output is now prefixed with libg15 to aid localising
  problems.
* Try to claim usb interface up to 10 times before failing
* Slow down initialisation, to allow keyboard to come out of usb
  auto-suspend on newer kernels.
* Attempt to combat ENOSPC by slowing down writes to the lcd if ENOSPC is received.  
  Unless that error occurs at least once, transfers are sent as normal.
